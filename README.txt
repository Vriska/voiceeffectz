This was an attempt to hear and see the effects caused by various modulation techniques and then further have a general envelop that controls both the frequency and amplitude of sound at any given movement. 
figuring out the amplitude was quite simple as its just a multiplication with the envelop but the frequency thing need to uses a modified version of SSB modulation. The modulation part did not work out well
due to  particular mathematical problem, SSB could be used to increase pitch rather easily, but getting the downward pitch decreases, that too at a predictable rate was hard and this is not imo the way
to achieve pitch correction.
